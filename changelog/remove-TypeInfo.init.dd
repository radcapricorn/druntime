`TypeInfo.init` now refers to type property.

`TypeInfo.init` used to refer to the method that is now called
$(REF_OBJECT_SHORT TypeInfo.initializer). The name change was necessary because
the name "init" would clash with the type property of the same name
($(GLINK2 property, init)). `TypeInfo.init` now refers to the type property.
